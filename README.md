## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Factorio ISR uses **six-layer modular architecture** for clean separation of concerns:

```
Factorio Servers (console.log + RCON)
         ↓
  [Input & Configuration Layer]
         ↓
  [Log Ingestion & Processing Layer]
         ↓
  [Discord Integration Layer]
         ↓
  [Server Control & Monitoring Layer]
         ↓
  [Bot Commands & Context Layer]
         ↓
  [Observability & Health Layer]
         ↓
Discord Channels + HTTP Health Endpoint
```

**Key components:**
- **ServerManager** – Orchestrates RCON, metrics, alerts per server
- **EventParser** – Pattern matching with ReDoS protection
- **DiscordBot** – Slash commands, event routing, login lifecycle
- **RconStatsCollector** – Periodic UPS/evolution snapshots
- **RconAlertMonitor** – Threshold-based alerting with cooldowns

**For detailed architecture:** See [**docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Multi-Step Setup Process

Factorio ISR requires configuration before launch. The setup involves:

1. **Create working directory** → `~/factorio-isr` with subdirectories (`config/`, `patterns/`, `.secrets/`)
2. **Create config files** → `servers.yml` (RCON + Discord channels), `mentions.yml` (optional)
3. **Populate pattern files** → `vanilla.yml` (core events), `custom.yml` (your patterns)
4. **Create secrets** → `.env` file (Discord token, RCON password)
5. **Customize docker-compose.yml** → Mount your Factorio console.log path
6. **Create Discord bot token** → Discord Developer Portal
7. **Launch and verify** → `docker compose up -d`, test events

### 📖 Installation Guide (15-30 minutes)

**🌟 START HERE:** [**docs/installation.md**](docs/installation.md)

Complete step-by-step guide covering:
- Creating directory structure
- Writing servers.yml, mentions.yml, patterns
- Setting up .env secrets (Discord token, RCON password)
- Configuring docker-compose.yml (volume mounts)
- Creating Discord bot and authorizing
- Launching ISR and verifying connectivity
- Testing event streaming
- Troubleshooting common issues

**Setup Time:** 15–30 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate/Hard (Docker, YAML, Discord setup)

## 🏥 Cursory Health Monitoring (next cycle of dev)

ISR exposes HTTP `/health` endpoint for orchestration:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
{"status": "healthy", "service": "factorio-isr"}
```

**Docker Compose:**
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
```

**Kubernetes:**
```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

**Test Coverage:** 80%+ across 1000+ tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific suite
pytest tests/test_event_parser.py -v

# Watch mode
pytest-watch
```

**Test Organization:**
- `test_MODULE.py` – Core logic (happy + error paths)
- `test_MODULE_hardened.py` – Security-focused tests
- `test_MODULE_intensified.py` – Performance & concurrency
- `test_MODULE_integration.py` – Multi-component flows
