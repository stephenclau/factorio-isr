# Contributor License Agreement

By contributing to Factorio ISR, you agree that:

1. **Copyright Ownership**  
   You retain copyright to your contributions.

2. **Dual-License Grant**  
   You grant Factorio ISR the right to license your contributions 
   under both:
   - AGPL-3.0 (open source)
   - Commercial licenses (paid)

3. **Why This Matters**  
   This allows us to offer commercial licenses that fund ongoing 
   development while keeping the project open source.

4. **Your Rights**  
   You can still use your contributions however you want. This 
   just gives us permission to include them in commercial licenses.
