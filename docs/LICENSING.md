# Licensing Guide

## Which License Should I Choose?

- ✅ You're willing to share your modifications publicly
- ✅ You're contributing to open source
- ✅ You're using it internally (no network distribution)
- ✅ You're okay with copyleft requirements

### Use Commercial License If:

- ❌ You want to integrate into proprietary software
- ❌ You're offering it as a hosted SaaS without open-sourcing
- ❌ Your legal team prohibits AGPL dependencies
- ❌ You need to keep modifications confidential
- ❌ You're modifying it for competitive advantage
